3. Using CIPRES what would the command line text of the above commands be if we were to run this in a terminal?  
update this!

4. Sequences from which species is/are most closely related to that of the "Flying Fox"?  
Synconycteris australis ace2
Rousettus leschenaultii ace2
Epomophorus wahlbergi ace2
Cynopterus sphinx ace2
Dobsonia viridis ace2

5. Why might such a phylogeny be useful in light of current events?
Phylogenetic trees help us understand the evolutionary relationships between species, including potential hosts and vectors for diseases. Phylogenetic trees are also helpful in our efforts to understand and apply conservation of species, and several species of flying foxes are listed on the IUCN Red List with varying conservation statuses, including endangered, vulnerable, and least concern. So this information might be helpful.

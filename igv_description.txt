The Nematolebias whitei killifish undergoes distinct larvae and diapause stages, with larvae exhibiting rapid growth and development, while diapause
allows the fish to enter a period of dormancy to survive adverse environmental conditions. In my screenshot blue stands for ATAC-Seq, orange stands for RNA-Seq,
and green stands for annotation. Highlighted in red is the region of interest. The figure is illustrating LOC119414798. The peaks in ATAC-Seq 
data suggest accessible chromatin regions, which are indicative of potential regulatory elements. Based on 
observations from the image, chromatin accessibility is similar between both stages because they have peaks around
the same region. I also observed RNA-Seq peaks exactly overlapping with the location of the gene, which could indicate
that the gene is actively being transcribed in the samples being analyzed. Finally, the region of interest has a roughly
10,000 bp distance  as indicated by the scale bar.
